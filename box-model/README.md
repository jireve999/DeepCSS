- default_box, border-box and content-box divs are already created inside the homework.html, and all have box_class className
- set padding=50px, border = 100px, margin = 200px for all of them to make everything be same
- set different background colors for all of them(content, border, and margin for all 3 divs) to make it more clear
- set different box-sizing for them to view the differences
- write javascript function to get height, offsetHeight, clientHeight to see the differences for all 3 divs
